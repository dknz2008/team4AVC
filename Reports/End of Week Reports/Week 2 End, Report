LAB attendance is 100% for week 2.

This week we didnt meet our pre-set Team Objective;
this is not a issue for this week as it will be useful to gauge progression.
Our team however did meet their personal tasks. 
Being on track the new tasks for week 3 have been set to suit our achievements thus far.
This tasks have been accepted by all team members as the way forward for your project.
All team members are finding their workloads about right, with our social chat on facebook
is proving useful for any help needed.

During this LAB we held a team meeting with the following results:-
Note - Meeting attendance 100% 
Topic: Robot design - Tracks against wheels for drive.
Taking into consideration these factors:-
Space for turning - As the tacks are wider than wheels will the AV be able to -
1. Pass through the gate.
2. Navigate the maze.
The result is yes and still has sufficient space.
Speed - Does it affect the AV speed and if so, positively or negatively.
We found that theoretically it should slow it down via friction and weight factors,
but increase torque. ie. turning ability.
Stability - How will stability be affected
Stability will be greatly increased reducing risk of turning over or terrian issues.
Potential coding problems - As the Robot may react in a different way when travelling,
so turns may have to be coded differently; our insight leads us to believe more coding would not be needed.
Power usuage - Will the tracks cause the power to drain faster.
We figure it will due to more friction and weight but not a huge amount.
Furthermore it may be reduced due to stability therefore line reading ability.

In conclusion, we had a majority vote rules and voted 5:0 in favor of tracks.
Sighting that the pros outweigh the cons and the team is enthusiastic to work with them.

AV and design photos to come, Ilan our Hardware Tech has a collection that will be uploaded this week.
No extra undesignated tasks needed to be performed this week.

AV = Autonomous Vehicle.

LAB is 100% 

Meeting on friday with Iland Dylan and Tom attending for group chat and catch up before the weekend.
Robot testing from Dylan earlier in the day and week saw progress to the end part of the second Quadrant.
Illan and Tom have gone through the code and learnt hwo the robot is working testing some theories on the robot 
to try and achieve through the 3rd quadrant.
We did not maanged to get past the T juncton, tried changing P on the PID to achieve better turning but found that 
new code was required for instance of all white line to all black. This meant code that read a strip infront of the 
robot ahead of the current readings to sight this issue and have a response for this situation.

Michael has adjusted some of his motor code this week.
Dylan has achieved progress on the white line and fulfilled his weekly tasks.
Illan has designed some sensor and battery mounts, as well as learning code
Kisuke has not commited anything.
Tom has completed reports and learnt the code and posed some of his own for a potential backup, to be tested.

Team objective has almost been reached with the AV now reading the line and turning corners successfully. 
Noting that the networking code has been achieved and that simply adding this to the main code will be done this week.

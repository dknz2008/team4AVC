LAB attendance this week is 100%

In todays lab progress of coding has been achieved with testing on the white line resulting in progress with the PID.
Dylan has done much of this himself achieveing his weekly task.
Ilan has also achieved learnign the code running through it with Tom to update themselves with the coding progress.
Tom has Written the weekly reports and kept up to date with the teams advances.
Michael has written some motor code and a help sheet which came in handy for reference.
Keisuke has not commited anything.

Today we had a team talk discussing our teams progress and where we should be. 
All attended this meeting and here are the results of that meeting.

Tuesday 2pm
100% attendance
Tom puts up for discussion that we have not achieved the code required at this stage. Sighting that we all need to 
increase out input into the team and achieve some results. Team agrees and that we will push hard this week to get 
the robot up to the 3rd quadrant. Using what other teams as a benchmark and a motivator to achieve.
We all leave the meeting happy with what is said and aiming to progress.
Keisuke and Tom have talekd about pushing forward and seeign some input on his behalf.

The Team objectives has not been met this week, this has raised concern on our project; Hence the meeting and progression 
seen from Dylan in our progress with the robot. 

New team tasks have been set high in an attempt to get the team up to where we need them to be.
The robot has not changed since the last time due to refocus of our hardware members to coding.
After todays LAB i think that we will still achieve to the maze, with maybe complications once within.

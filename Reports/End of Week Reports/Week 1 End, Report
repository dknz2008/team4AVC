LAB attendance is 100% for week 1.

Everyone was sent away with either research tasks or small code solving problems.
Due to the lab being closed over the holidays and the Physics mid term test, no physical work was done on the Robot other than in the 
lab that week.
Using Social media Facebook we have set up a talk group for dicussions and meetings.

Michael being appointed our main Software writer, has created some code with the help of Dylan for the robot motors to work.
Tom this week has researched the Networking gate and how it works with Dylan creating the code and placing it onto our github.
Keisuke acting as Hardware support and Material reusability, he has drew some ideas of the AV's wiring and battery placement this week. 
With our Hardware tech Ilan designing some ideas for our robot build, he threw up for discussion for a wall climber design.
All teams have performed there given task well this week and will be progressing forward on schedule with a tasks.

MEETING ON AV DESIGN:-
Everyone but Ilan could attend this meeting.
We had a team talk on Friday afternoon (22nd April), discussing the potential of a wall climbing option -
Noting that the rules and what the client would want in a real life situation; we decided AGAINST this by majority (4:0).
As having the AV navigate the course properly with the code would be the more well programmed robot.
( i.e. the robot would not find a wall by itself with direct programming the walls direction into the code.)
These were seen as some key tasks for us to follow.
 
We have not updated our GitHub with all the photos, these will come in the following weeks to monitor progress.

We are yet to decide on if report drafting from all the Team members is neccessary.
In summary, the team is on track with progress and position and tasks have been designated.
 
AV = Autonomous Vechicle

Report by Tom, with input from all team members.

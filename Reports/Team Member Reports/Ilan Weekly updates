This week I got the basics set up, need to cut the front so the camera can see the ground. Chose to use tracks instead of
wheels as the robot can turn on the spot although it will be slower due to the increased friction and the motors turning two
wheels instead of one. I think the pros outweigh the cons in this matter.

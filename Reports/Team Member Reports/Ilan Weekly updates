This week I got the basics set up, need to cut the front so the camera can see the ground. Chose to use tracks instead of
wheels as the robot can turn on the spot although it will be slower due to the increased friction and the motors turning two
wheels instead of one. I think the pros outweigh the cons in this matter.

week 6 I did not spend as much time on AVC as I should have but I started designing a better way to mount the 2 circuit boards and the battery. 

Week 7 I have designed and printed the rest of the parts needed to complete the robot, including IR sensor mounts and 2 different mounts for the PCB 

had a problem with the tracks after the redesign of the robot, because it was heavier there was more friction on the tracks and it
caused them to keep falling off so i had to move them back to make the tracks tighter. 
made a bracket to hold the battery in. bot is very front heavy and needs the battery as a counterweight. code is coming along nicely.
I have peer coded with Dylan and Tom for the last week and it is getting a lot better.

Linux command line help:
  ls = list files in directory
  cd = change directory
  cd .. = change directory to the one above
  cp <filename> <destination directory> = copys the file into the given file directory (You have to be in the directory of the file you want to copy)
  mv <filename> <destination directory> = same as copy but moves
  rm filename = deletes (removes) file

  Github help:
    git clone https://github.com/dknz2008/team4AVC = Clones the Github repository (Only need to do this once) (Our gitclone is located on the pi in folder ~/E101/avc/team4AVC)
    git pull = Fetches the files from the repository and merges it with your local one on the pi
    git push = Pushes all the modified local objects on the pi to the repository
    git commit -a -m "<commit message>" = Commits to github

Compilation:
  without makefile = gcc -o <desired end filename> <filename.cpp> -lE101
  with makefile = make (the makefile must have the filename specified that you want to compile)
  
Execute:
  sudo ./<compiled filename>
  
Notes:
  Some directories on the pi are not able to be saved to and will give an error saying permission denied
    -A way around this is to make a copy the folder that you cant save to with a different name and it should resolve the problem

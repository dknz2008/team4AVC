This is some psudeocode to process what our code needs to achieve.

Pixel reading from Camera.

With a 320 pixel camera, this needs to be a loop that reads from left to right.
From the readings assigning each pixel to either black or white
Having the code react to a set of white pixels (around 20 pixels wide)
Having the robot set variables to these numbers for use in the motor functions

The Motor Functions

For a straight forward movement have the black pixels left and the right of the white line even or close to . 
If statement for left turning, if the robot reads more black pixels on the left of the white line then turn 
reduce speed of the left motor. Have this amplify the more black pixels on the left vs the pixels on the right.

For the turn right function the same as left but in reverse.

For when the white line is across the whole pixel range, the motors do not change speed i.e. doesnt alter course

For when the Robot gets to a dead end no white pixels. Stop, reverse using PID and then 180 degree turn until white line is picked up.
Carrying on as usual.

Infrared sensors

For the slow down method. Have the robot reduce speed when approaching a object regardless of colour. 
This would require a sensor in front of the robot. This infrared sensor will take a reading of light. 
With when reading a white wall it
